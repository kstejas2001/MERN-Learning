2: Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules

ðŸ“Œ Line Break (<br>)
    -- Adds a new line inside a paragraph.
    -- It's an empty tag (no closing).

    Example:
    <p>This is first line.<br>This is second line from same paragraph.</p>

ðŸ“Œ Horizontal Rule (<hr>)
    -- Draw a Horizontal line across the page.
    -- Often used to separate sections.

    Example:
    <h2>Section One</h2>
    <p>Content of section one.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Section Two</h2>
    <p>Content of section two.</p>

<br> â†’ break the line inside text (new line).
<hr> â†’ separates sections with a line.
